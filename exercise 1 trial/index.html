</div>
<img src="img/domestic.jfif">

<br>Based on traditional setting from Home Going book,women didn’t have much of a say in the community.Their work specifically was to bear children, raise them,take care of their husbands and keep the homesteads in order.They faced domestic violence for instance Baabe would get a beating from Cobbe everytime time she would beat Effia.Fante wives were not entrusted to inheritance after their White husbands died for instance when Millicent’s father died, he left his inheritance to his friends and fellow soldiers to manage on behalf of his wife.Women has no say concerning who was to marry them,Adwoa got married to a white person because her mother had decided for her.Women were sold out to slavery if they got pregnant before marriage.We see this where Afua from Asante land was sold out   to slavery since she was pregnant before marriage.</br>
