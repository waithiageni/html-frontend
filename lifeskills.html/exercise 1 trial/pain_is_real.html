		<h1>THE PAIN IS REAL IT SHOULD BE GIVEN RESPECT</h1>
		
  		<p>Have you ever wondered what your life could be if you didn't have anyone to put a roof over your head, a two or a three meal on a daily basis. Think about it and see how grateful you should be, think of those of your age who didn't stance to have the level of education that you have now. Take a moment to think of the number of youths your age that are struggling with broken marriages, drug abuse,crime,rehabilitations,unethical and unempathetical jobs. The world is full of struggles some people's struggles are way much painful than others, for instance you, yes you your struggles are way much less than that young mother living in the streets, that young youth living in Turkana with drought beating around her.</p>
  	
  		
		<p>You keep on stressing your mother to tell you about your father who intentionally denied you even before you saw the face of this world. You are forgetting of what struggles she has gone through to keep you and your siblings fed ,to keep you in school and have you readily dressed up to any kind of weather .  What of those who didn’t stand a chance to meet either of their parents, to whom do you think they do ask such questions? Learn to appreciate what you have at your disposal.
		She became a newly single mom over 18 years ago. Back then it was difficult finding other single moms who were doing more than surviving.</p>

		<p>She wanted to do more than survive…She wanted to thrive and be successful in her career and her journey as a mother.
		Unfortunately, there weren’t many books on the topic of surviving as a single mom, but she took your life and hers in her hands and struggled like never before</p>
		<p>Her stories weren’t always conveyed in a positive light.
		But, she longed to know that there were successful single moms out there killing it, at whatever they chose to pursue in life.
		She is a proud single mother of two beautiful kids. In the absence of your father, mothering has been her profession, her hobby, her life.</p>

		<p>Raising her kids alone has driven her to work harder. She teaches in the morning and she freelance in the evenings at home. She used her writing craft to earn extra income for your needs. It was hard for her to have two jobs at a time but knowing there are children with her, there was no time to give up.</p>

		<p>She had to condition herself and you with a routine where you can keep her in silence while working at home. She created the night in such a way that you slept early for her to work extra freely through the night. And for quite some time then, her children got used to seeing her work so hard through the night to make ends meet for her whole family at home.</p> 

		<p>Do not hate her for not having your father around. Never disrespect your mother because she is single, don’t ignore and under estimate her sacrifices. She gave your life, she raised you better than anyone else could, and she gave and kept trying to give you better than anyone could ever give apart from her. She never wished unwell for you and you siblings in her wildest dreams. She is always tried showing right path and being a motivator. Mothers give up all for kids, forgive all mistakes made by kids.  There is no way to repay what they done for their kids, all you can do is try giving what they need and it is just time, love and respect.</p>
